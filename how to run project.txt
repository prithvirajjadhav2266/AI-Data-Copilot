🔧 Setup (First Time)

Open project in VS Code

Open the folder Ai_Data_copilot in VS Code.

Create a virtual environment

In the VS Code terminal:

python -m venv .venv


Activate the virtual environment

On Windows (PowerShell):

.venv\Scripts\activate


You should see (.venv) at the beginning of the terminal prompt.

Install dependencies

Make sure you are in the project root (where requirements.txt is), then run:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Configure Gemini API key

The backend expects a Google Gemini key via the environment variable GEMINI_API_KEY. In PowerShell:

$Env:GEMINI_API_KEY = "your-api-key"

Optionally override the model or temperature:

$Env:GEMINI_MODEL = "models/gemini-2.5-flash"
$Env:GEMINI_TEMPERATURE = "0.1"

If you previously set a different model with `setx`, open a fresh PowerShell window after updating the value so the backend sees the change.

🤖 LLM Workflows

- **Cleaning Plan**: Use the "Gemini Cleaning Plan" panel in Streamlit to request structured cleaning steps. Dry-run before applying to persist changes.
- **Code Agent**: Use the "Gemini Code Agent" panel for free-form analytics or transformations. The model returns Python `transform(df)` code executed in a restricted backend sandbox. Always dry-run first to inspect the summary and preview.
- All LLM proposals and executions are logged in the backend audit trail for traceability.

🚀 Running the Project

You’ll run two processes:

One for backend (FastAPI)

One for frontend (Streamlit)

1️⃣ Start the Backend (FastAPI)

In VS Code terminal (with venv active):

python -m uvicorn backend.app:app --reload


You should see something like:

INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     Application startup complete.


🔹 If you open http://127.0.0.1:8000/ and see 404 Not Found, that’s normal.
There is no route defined for /. Use /docs instead.

You can test the API docs here (optional):
👉 http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

⚠️ Keep this terminal open. Don’t stop it.

2️⃣ Start the Frontend (Streamlit)

Open a new terminal in VS Code:

Activate the virtual environment again:

.venv\Scripts\activate


Run Streamlit:

streamlit run frontend/app.py


You’ll see something like:

  You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.

  Local URL: http://localhost:8501


Open this in your browser:

👉 http://localhost:8501

Backend = http://127.0.0.1:8000
Frontend = http://localhost:8501

Both must be running at the same time.
